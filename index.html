                            Hello, I'm Manoel McCadden.  
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm an audio and systems programmer, audio engineer, and audio designer 
                            passionate about bridging the gap between audio and technology.
                            I began my programming journey coding in C# and Java for class in high 
                            school and as my understanding grew my love deepened. With years of 
                            experience in music through concert and jazz band, I began exploring 
                            music through a technical lens and found my calling. My goals are 
                            developing and improving products/projects through efficiency and cohesion,
                            while adding to the user's experience and immersion.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently entering my junior year at DigiPen Institute of Technology,
                            where I am studying for my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
                            Digital Audio. Through my time at DigiPen I have worked on and completed
                            three different team-based game projects and have explored various 
                            passions and ideas through independent projects. Through these experiences, I 
                            have learned and honed valuable skills in programming (systems, graphics, and audio),
                            teamwork, task management, and project cycles.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Beyond my programming work, I love performing and practicing jazz where
                            I primarily play the Baritone Saxophone. I also adore working in my school's 
                            studio, providing audio support for my school's live events, and playing video
                            games with my friends.

                            A browser-based polyphonic synthesizer
                            using p5.js that features four distinct waveforms 
                            and real-time visualization. While initially
                            developed as a tool to help teach high school
                            students the basics of programming, it evolved into 
                            a personal project exploring audio synthesis 
                            through visualization.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Key Features:
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - 4 selectable waveforms
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Polyphonic playback for chords and
                            harmonies
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Interactive drag and drop GUI
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - MIDI-style input using a standard
                            computer keyboard
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Live visualization of frequency,
                            amplitude, and MIDI note data
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A key technical challenge I faced during this
                            project was attempting to mitigate the audible
                            'clicks' from oscillators as they started and stopped
                            While I implemented solutions such as amplitude
                            ramping and ADSR envelopes, I found that the 
                            key issue lay within the lack of granular control
                            given through the p5 framework. Through this
                            experience I have learned valuable information in
                            synthesis visualization and look forward to
                            re-implementing this through C++ and portaudio
                            and/or juce in the future to gain greater control
                            over the audio stream and produce seamless output.

                            A basic synth built using javascript's P5 framework
                            and it's native audio functionality to play 4
                            different wave patterns while visualizing the
                            frequency and amplitude of each wave form on a
                            graph.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This project began as a testing ground for p5 while
                            I learned it to help teach incoming high school
                            students the basics of programming through a fun and
                            interactive lens. Through my time researching and
                            understanding p5 I dove into it's sound
                            functionality and landed upon an example on their
                            website detailing simple mouse position-based audio.
                            From there I made it my goal to create a GUI that
                            allowed users to experiment with p5's array of
                            waveforms and explore visually the logrithimic nature
                            of musical frequencies.

                            <br>
                            Features Include:
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - 4 Different playable wave forms
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Polyphonic through sustaining notes
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Drag and drop GUI
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Computer keyboard MIDI keybindings
                            <br>&nbsp&nbsp - Frequency information and MIDI note
                            value

                            <br>
                            One of the major challenges I faced through this
                            project was attempting to handle the click of
                            starting and stoping p5's oscillators. I attempted
                            to minimize the clicking by having the amplitude of
                            the oscilator slowly ramp up to the desired
                            amplitude on start and down to 0 on a stop and 
                            using an ADSR envelope but found that neither solution 
                            entirly fixed the problem (with them each creating new
                            problesm of their own).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Despite this challenge I am very happy with the end
                            result and the potential this idea has to go even
                            further. In order to accomplish more with this
                            project I plan to migrate and continue my work in
                            C++ using portaudio and GTK so that I can have more
                            grainular control of the inner workings of the audio
                            output and focus the implementation towards this
                            projects specific need.

                            My newest piece for DigiPen's Jazz Dragons arranged throughout late 2024 and into early 2025.
                            First debuted by the Jazz Dragons in late April of the same year.
                            Originally called <i>Oil Field Base</i> and done as an arrangement of the level of the same name, 
                            this piece turned into a suite with custom transitions to showcase some of my favorite songs 
                            and moments from the SNES classic <i>U.N. Squadron</i>. All music transcribed and arranged was 
                            composed by Manami Matsumae and helps to convey the journey as you fight for the mighty
                            country of Asran.

                            This piece was arranged in June of 2024 and brought to
                            DigiPen's Jazz Dragons in September of the same year,
                            where we performed it for the first time that December. 
                            <i>Driftveil City</i> comes from <i>Pokemon Black and White</i> and 
                            was composed by Hitomi Sato featuring an iconic melody, 
                            deep groovy bassline, and some perfect jazzy chords for 
                            a 12-piece jazz ensemble.
